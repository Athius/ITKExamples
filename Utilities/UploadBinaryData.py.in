Upload binary data to Midas.

Since every local Git repository contains a copy of the entire project history,
it is important to avoid adding large binary files directly to the repository.
Large binary files added and removed through the history of a project will cause
the repository to become bloated, take up too much disk space, require excessive
time and bandwidth to download, etc.

The solution to this problem adopted by this project is to store binary files,
such as images, in a separate location outside the repository, then download the
files at build time with CMake.

A "content link" file containing an identifying MD5 checksum is stored in the
Git repository at the path where the file would exist with the ".md5" extension
added to the file.  CMake will find these content link files at build time,
download them from a list of server resources, and create symlinks or copies of
the original files at the corresponding location in the build tree.

The Midas server at

  http://midas3.kitware.com/midas/

is an ITK community resource where any community member can upload binary data
files.  This script automates the upload of data to the server and generation of
the content link file.
